# SchoolElectionSystem
A school voting system wherein the Head Boy, Head Girl and Ruby-Captain are elected by the students and the teachers. This project is executed using Python3. 
Initially, the teacher or the student who is about to cast the vote has to be validated to ensure their authenticity and then the voting process starts. 
The votes are cast by the particular person and the votes are added to the candidates. Their votes are totalled up and compared before it is posted. The declare results option displays the person who got the maximum votes in each category.
